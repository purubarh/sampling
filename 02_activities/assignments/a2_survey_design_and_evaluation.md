# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `2`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of this survey is to understand voter's priorities, concerns, and expectations from our party and its leader one month before the federal election. The findings will help identify which policy areas, leadership qualities, and campaign messages are most important to maintain voter support and persuade undecided voters. This information will guide final campaign strategy and communications.
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target Population - Eligible Canadian Voters over age 18 years and older who are eligible to vote in the upcoming election
Sampling Frame - Election Canada published voters list with party's internal voter contact databse
Sampling units - Individual Voters
Observation units - Each Individual Canadian Voter who participated in Survey

Overall sampling strategy - I choose, A stratified random sampling approach to ensure representation across key demographics such as province/territiry, age, gender, language, and residence areas (urban vs rural).
```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
Mutiple Choice Question #1-4
Open Ended Question #5
1. How faourable is your opinion about our Party? 
2. Which of the following issues are most important to you when deciding to vote? 
3. How confident are you that our party can effectively address the issues that matter most to you?
4. How would you rate our party leader’s performance so far in the campaign?
5. What could our party do to better earn or maintain your support?
6. write your question here... (optional)
7. write your question here... (optional)
8. write your question here... (optional)
9. write your question here... (optional)
10. write your question here... (optional)
```

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```
1. Sample type - Cross-sectional stratified two-phase design
2. Sample size - The total sample size for the SGVP is 80,000 individuals (60,000 regular sample, 20,000 oversample).
3. Target population - Persons aged 15 years and over living in private households in Canada, excluding residents of the Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut and full time residents of institutions
4. Sampling frame - household and person
5. Survey mode(s) - Online questionnaire, Telephone and In-person Interviews
6. Timeline
7. Response rate - The overall response rate was 40.9% (42.2% for the regular sample and 37.1% for the oversample).
8. Weights - The number of persons represented by a given person in the sample is usually known as the weight or weighting factor.  In a simple random sample of 2% of a population size of 1000, each person in the sample represents 50 persons in the population
9. Data processing - Used Microdata File(PUMF)
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc - All imputations were made using donor imputation. This method uses donor records selected through a score function to impute missing values.The donor with the highest score filled in the missing information. If multiple donors had the highest score, one was randomly selected. Mean imputation was used when donor imputation could not be used.
11. Sources of error - Coverage error, response error and processing error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc - Non-response bias
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used - https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/45250011
